## Status : Closed
### Since there are many more websites that are gathering the data in a much better way. So, I am closing this project now.

**Motive**

As a developer, I also want to do something during this huge pandemic situation, so I develop a website to automatically trace out the required data. This is a small thanks from my side to all those who are working out onto the field and fighting with Covid19.

**Features**
1. All of the required data at one place
2. Statewise information
3. Well maintained archives

----------

**Prerequisites**

Nothing more than just a web-browser and internet.
